# Banggood price and code checker

Use at own risk. This extension doesn't send any data, uses what is in browser and browser local storage.
Check manifest.json to see what is accessed by extension.

Extension tracks prices on shopping card and on wish list so you know real promos. Because prices are stored locally price history isn't available on other computers.

Clicking BG button on shopping card will apply all coupons from bg_codes and select one with best discount.
